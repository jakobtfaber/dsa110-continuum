"""End-to-end smoke test for the bad-polarization detection wiring.

Generates a tiny synthetic UVH5 with a known single-polarization failure on one
antenna, converts it to a CASA Measurement Set via pyuvdata, runs
``run_pre_calibration_flagging`` with ``enable_bad_pol_detection=True``, and
asserts that detection runs end-to-end against the real CASA path: the
injected antenna lands in the detected set and CASA ``flagdata`` calls
persist new flags into the MS.

This is the integration counterpart to the mock-based unit tests in
``test_run_pre_calibration_flagging.py`` and ``test_detect_bad_polarizations.py``.
The mock tests cover the function's contract under controlled inputs; this
smoke test proves the wiring works against real CASA tables — without
overconstraining label conventions, since the MS-coherence detection path
has a known pol-label ambiguity under amplitude-imbalanced injection (see
the in-test comment and the tracked GitHub issue for follow-up).

Skipped by default in fast runs — opt in with ``pytest --run-slow`` (project
``conftest.py`` gate). Marker selection alone (``-m "slow"``) is not enough
because the marker is added at collection time only when ``--run-slow`` is
passed.
