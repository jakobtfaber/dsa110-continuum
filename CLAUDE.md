# CLAUDE.md

A radio astronomy continuum imaging pipeline for DSA-110 (Deep Synoptic Array, 110 antennas) at OVRO, ported from the older `dsa110-contimg` codebase. Science goal: detect variable/transient compact radio sources (ESEs) via daily-cadenced per-source forced photometry on hourly-epoch mosaics (~1 hour each).

Verified working state: `scripts/run_pipeline.py` produces a calibrated image of 3C454.3 at 12.5 Jy/beam against test HDF5 in `/data/incoming/` on H17.

## Data flow

```text
HDF5 (16 subbands × N timestamps)
  → [conversion/]   MS
  → [calibration/]  flagging + bandpass/gain solve + applycal
  → [imaging/]      phaseshift → WSClean (wgridder/IDG) → 4800×4800 px FITS tile (~5-min transit)
  → [mosaic/]       tiles → hourly-epoch mosaic (Quicklook or Science/Deep); ~12 tiles/epoch with overlap
  → [photometry/]   forced photometry → variability metrics → light curves
```

Science cadence: hourly-epoch mosaics of ~12 sequential tiles (~1 hour) along the current *Dec strip*, with overlap into adjacent epochs. **Not** a single 24-hour mosaic. Two operational modes: *batch* (UTC-hour bins, ±2 tiles overlap; current production) and *sliding* (12-tile window, stride 6; streaming target). See `CONTEXT.md` for citations.

## Key paths

Host-specific — workflows should use per-host roots rather than assuming a single one.

```text
H17 / dsacamera:
  /data/incoming/                  raw HDF5 files
  /stage/dsa110-contimg/ms/        Measurement Sets
  /opt/miniforge/envs/casa6        CASA conda env (use this for ALL pipeline work)

H23 (correlator):
  /dataz/dsa110/operations/correlator/   raw correlator data (ZFS)

Optional sibling checkouts (useful when present):
  /data/radio-pipelines/askap-vast       reference for orchestration / QA parity
  /data/dsa110-antpos                    `ant_ids*.csv` for antenna-selection cross-checks
```

Do NOT track Measurement Sets or other large stage/correlation data in Git.

## Collaboration preferences

- When repo/runtime state is uncertain, prefer tests, diagnostics, or filesystem inspection over asking — ground recommendations in concrete evidence.
- Default to short, plain one-sentence answers unless asked for more depth.

<important if="you need to run anything in this repo (tests, scripts, lint, pipeline)">

ALWAYS use the casa6 conda env: `/opt/miniforge/envs/casa6/bin/python`. It has numpy, casacore, astropy, CASA. System `python3` is 3.13 (no scientific deps). The `pip` shim points to system 3.8 — if you need pip, use `/opt/miniforge/envs/casa6/bin/python -m pip`.

Set `PYTHONPATH=/workspace` when running scripts/tests from this workspace context (no editable install is assumed; console scripts `dsa110-health`/`dsa110-validate` come from `pyproject.toml` when installed).

<important if="the casa6 conda env is unavailable (cloud VM, Cursor Cloud, fresh container)">

Fallback: system Python 3.12 with `PYTHONPATH=/workspace` mandatory.

The old cloud-VM compatibility shim (`~/.local/lib/python3.12/site-packages/dsa110_contimg_shim.py` + its `.pth` loader) is obsolete: `dsa110_continuum` is self-contained and never imports `dsa110_contimg`. If a cloud VM still has the shim installed, delete both files — nothing depends on them.

All `casacore.tables` imports use `dsa110_continuum.adapters.casa_tables` — a drop-in wrapper over `casatools.table` — to avoid the C++ shared-library conflict that segfaults when both `python-casacore` and `casatools` load. The wrapper handles row-axis layout differences (`_rows_first`/`_rows_last`).

After installing `casatools` in a cloud VM, fix the bundled SQLite conflict:

```bash
rm ~/.local/lib/python3.12/site-packages/casatools/__casac__/lib/libsqlite3.so.0
ln -s /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libsqlite3.so.0 ~/.local/lib/python3.12/site-packages/casatools/__casac__/lib/libsqlite3.so.0
```

Cloud-only test failures (pre-existing, not bugs):

- `test_ensure_calibration::test_fallback_full_sky_when_no_obs_dec` — needs VLA calibrator DB at `/data/dsa110-contimg/state/catalogs/vla_calibrators.sqlite3`.
- `test_epoch_gaincal::test_wsclean_runs_when_flag_fraction_below_limit` — mock expects single `subprocess.run` but epoch gaincal makes two WSClean invocations.

Telescope data paths (`/data/incoming/`, `/stage/dsa110-contimg/ms/`) do not exist on the cloud VM. Tests/scripts use mocks or skip gracefully.

</important>

<important if="you are importing, testing, or running anything under `dsa110_continuum.mosaic.*`">

Pure-Python `dsa110_continuum.mosaic.*` imports (including the whole package `__init__`) do NOT require `/dev/shm/dsa110-contimg/` or any Dagster bootstrap. The legacy Dagster science-mosaic bridge is retired: `ScienceMosaicBridgeJob.execute()` in `mosaic/science_jobs.py` validates its inputs and then raises `RuntimeError` pointing at the visibility-domain coadd via `scripts/batch_pipeline.py`. Regression test: `tests/test_mosaic_import_no_dagster.py`. Do NOT add any `dsa110_contimg` imports under `dsa110_continuum/mosaic/` — the legacy namespace is banned repo-wide (CI enforces via `scripts/check_import_migration.py`).

</important>

<important if="you are linting or considering bulk style fixes">

~1300 pre-existing ruff violations exist (as of 2026-05; whitespace W293/W291, unsorted imports I001, missing docstrings D103). Keep new code clean but DO NOT bulk-fix existing violations — they are tracked separately.

</important>

<important if="you are adding or modifying imports, package __init__.py, or anything that runs at import time">

`dsa110_continuum/` is the canonical package and is **self-contained**: it never imports the retired `dsa110_contimg` namespace, which is banned repo-wide — CI enforces this via `scripts/check_import_migration.py` (exit 1 on any hit) and a ruff `banned-api` rule in `pyproject.toml`. The `__init__.py` re-export layers import from `dsa110_continuum.*` siblings (regression test: `tests/test_init_reexports_new_namespace.py`). The old package installed at `/data/dsa110-contimg/backend/src` on H17 co-loads safely in the same process: the vendored `dsa110_continuum.workflow` registry is a distinct object from the old package's, so double job-registration cannot occur.

Cross-package `__init__` chains can circular-import: `qa/__init__` → `qa.calibration_quality` → `calibration/__init__` → `qa_compare` re-enters `qa.calibration_quality` mid-import. The package guards swallow the ImportError, so the symptom is a *silently missing* re-export, order-dependent. `qa_compare` defers its qa import to function scope for this reason; prefer function-scope imports for new cross-package (`calibration` ↔ `qa`, etc.) references from modules reachable at package-init time.

</important>

<important if="you are running batch_pipeline.py for production or smoke testing">

Use `--dry-run` before real compute to verify MS discovery, calibration-table resolution, checkpoint state, quarantine state, and rebuild/skip decisions:

```bash
/opt/miniforge/envs/casa6/bin/python scripts/batch_pipeline.py \
  --date 2026-01-25 --start-hour 22 --end-hour 23 \
  --dry-run --quarantine-after-failures 3
```

Production smoke-test pattern (default-strict QA, bounded runtime, retry, parallel photometry):

```text
--quarantine-after-failures 3 --tile-timeout 1800 --retry-failed \
--photometry-workers 4 --photometry-chunk-size 0
```

Operational flags:

- `--dry-run` prints execution plan, exits before writing run products.
- `--quarantine-after-failures N` skips MS entries whose checkpoint failure count reaches N. `--clear-quarantine` resets counts.
- QA gating is strict by default: QA-FAIL epochs do NOT run forced photometry or archive mosaics. `--lenient-qa` is a diagnostic override only.
- `--photometry-workers` enables process-based parallelism. `--photometry-chunk-size 0` uses automatic deterministic chunking.
- `--cal-date` takes a bare date (`2026-01-25`), NOT a timestamp. The code appends `T22:26:05` internally; passing a full timestamp produces a wrong path.

Each real run writes `run_<utc>.log`, `{date}_manifest.json`, `{date}_run_summary.json`, `run_report.md` under the date products directory.

Validated H17 result: `2026-01-25` hour 22 rebuilt 11 tiles → `/stage/dsa110-contimg/images/mosaic_2026-01-25/2026-01-25T2200_mosaic.fits`. QA failed on catalog completeness → manifest verdict `DEGRADED`, photometry skipped, `run_report.md` captured the failure.

</important>

<important if="you are working on calibration: bandpass, gain, applycal, or table discovery">

BP/G table acquisition order (must match implementation; update both this section and code in the same PR):

1. Same-date tables if valid.
2. Generate from primary flux calibrator transit (preferred).
3. Generate from bright-source VLA catalog fallback.
4. Borrow nearest validated tables (strip-compatibility required).
5. Fail loudly. NEVER proceed silently with unknown calibration provenance.

Bright-source fallback search: if `obs_dec_deg` is known, search is Dec-local (configured tolerance). If unknown, search uses full-sky Dec range to avoid false "no usable calibrator" failures.

Legacy table names like `/stage/dsa110-contimg/ms/{date}T22:26:05_0~23.{b,g}` are still supported. Manual symlinking from a validated reference date is acceptable for operational recovery, but must satisfy strip-compatibility validation.

See `CONTEXT.md` `## Calibration` for vocabulary (table conventions, borrowing semantics, `flux_anchor`, `selection_pool`, refant default, provenance sidecar) and `docs/reference/calibration.md` for K/B/G parameters, DEFAULT_PRESET, SelfCalConfig, and `bp_minsnr=5.0` (NOT the function default of 3.0).

</important>

<important if="you are refactoring conversion, phaseshift, or imaging code">

Three silent-failure invariants that produce no exception but yield wrong science. They MUST be preserved.

1. **`FIELD::PHASE_DIR` after `chgcentre`.** WSClean's `chgcentre` may not update `FIELD::PHASE_DIR`. Patch with `update_phase_dir_to_target(ms_path, ra_deg, dec_deg)`. Symptom if missing: CASA computes phase gradients vs the old field centre → smeared/offset sources.

2. **`FIELD::REFERENCE_DIR` sync.** CASA's `ft()` reads `REFERENCE_DIR` (not `PHASE_DIR`) when computing model visibilities for self-cal and sky model prediction. After phaseshift, both must be updated: `sync_reference_dir_with_phase_dir(ms_path)`. Symptom: `MODEL_DATA` predicted at wrong sky position; self-cal diverges; sky model seeded at offset.

3. **`TELESCOPE_NAME = DSA_110` before each WSClean run.** `merge_spws()` (required before IDG) resets `OBSERVATION::TELESCOPE_NAME` to `OVRO_MMA` for CASA compatibility. EveryBeam needs `DSA_110`. Patch with `set_ms_telescope_name(ms_path, name="DSA_110")`. This is automatic inside `run_wsclean()` — preserve it if you change the imaging workflow. Symptom if missing: EveryBeam silently selects the wrong beam model → primary beam errors up to ~20% near field edge.

4. **FIELD direction column shape normalization.** `FIELD::PHASE_DIR` and `FIELD::REFERENCE_DIR` may appear as rows-first `(nfields, 1, 2)` or CASA column-major `(nfields, 2, 1)`. Fresh converted MS via the CASA table adapter typically return `(nfields, 2, 1)`. Code touching these columns must normalize both shapes via the calibration runner helpers — do NOT hard-code `(nfields, 1, 2)` indexing.

</important>

<important if="you are using ThreadPoolExecutor or signal-handling code">

The `@memory_safe` decorator uses `SIGALRM`, which only works in the main thread. Combining with `ThreadPoolExecutor` raises `ValueError: signal only works in main thread`. Use `ProcessPoolExecutor` instead.

</important>

<important if="you are touching imaging/cli_utils.py or interpreting CORRECTED_DATA fallbacks">

`detect_datacolumn()` raises `RuntimeError` if `CORRECTED_DATA` exists but is all zeros. It only falls back to `DATA` when `CORRECTED_DATA` is genuinely absent. This is intentional, not a silent failure.

</important>

<important if="you are saving derived artifacts (figures, PNGs, CSVs, FITS previews)">

Save under `/data/dsa110-continuum/outputs/` (organize by topic or date). Do NOT leave user-facing artifacts in `/tmp`.

</important>

<important if="you are touching FastAPI services: dsa110_continuum/mosaic/api.py, scripts/qa_server.py, or scripts/monitor_server.py">

Three FastAPI services exist; their statuses differ:

- `dsa110_continuum/mosaic/api.py` — **dormant**. Defines a router but no caller currently mounts it. Do NOT assume users hit this path; verify the mount before changing behavior.
- `scripts/qa_server.py` — **live**. The QA dashboard users currently rely on. Treat as production: changes need the same care as pipeline code.
- `scripts/monitor_server.py` — **live, host-ops**. Exposes a `POST /exec` shell hook; any change to that endpoint is a security-relevant edit and must be flagged.

The live-observability-stack work lands across these services; tracking issues #48–#62 (`gh issue list --label needs-triage --state open`).

</important>

<important if="you are reasoning about instrument geometry, data volumes, or observation cadence">

See `CONTEXT.md` `## Instrument` and `## Pipeline stages and products` for antenna count, dish size, band/subband structure, integration time, tile geometry, and hourly-epoch mosaic definition (batch and sliding modes), all with `path::Symbol` citations. Use the glossary's vocabulary verbatim — *tile*, *hourly-epoch mosaic*, *Dec strip* (not "RA strip", not "daily mosaic", not "snapshot/frame"); see `docs/agents/domain.md`.

Two non-obvious science facts:

- **Sliding-window mosaic parameters describe product cadence, not beam overlap.** "Tiles per mosaic" and "stride" set how successive mosaic products are built from the tile stream — they do NOT describe how many tile beams overlap any given sky location. The latter follows beam geometry, drift spacing, and coadd weights.
- **Per-position mosaic depth saturates after ~3 overlapping drift tiles** for compact-source variability science. Hour-scale windowed mosaics are the default science product; >1-hour / full-day coadds are diagnostic, not default science.

`scripts/batch_pipeline.py` runs an early Dec-strip guard (`check_dec_strip` vs `--expected-dec`, default 16.1°) when a same-date MS is present. Pointing declination flows from HDF5/UVH5 into the MS during conversion; the batch driver reads Dec from the MS, not by reopening HDF5.

<important if="you are implementing the VAST → DSA-110 methodology plan in outputs/pipeline-comparison-2026-05-14/vast_to_dsa110_implementation_plan.md">

Full plan: `outputs/pipeline-comparison-2026-05-14/vast_to_dsa110_implementation_plan.md`.
VAST reference codebase: `/data/radio-pipelines/askap-vast/` (read-only reference; do NOT modify it).

### What the plan says to create vs. what already exists

The plan was written before a full filesystem audit. Several files it describes as "new" already exist. Verify before writing:

| Plan says | Actual state |
| --- | --- |
| Create `photometry/metrics.py` | Already exists (170 lines). Contains `calculate_eta_metric`, `calculate_v_metric`, `calculate_sigma_deviation`, `calculate_weighted_mean/variance/chi_squared`. The VAST-canonical η formula (`(N/(N-1)) * [mean(w·f²) − mean(w·f)²/mean(w)]`) is already implemented correctly at line 112. Do NOT recreate — extend or consolidate. |
| Create `photometry/association.py` | Does NOT exist. This is a genuine gap. |
| "All-pairs Vs/m absent" (G4) | `multi_epoch.py::calc_two_epoch_pair_metrics()` (line 548) already computes all N(N-1)/2 pairs using a double loop, and `get_most_significant_pair()` (line 618) selects the max-\|Vs\| pair above a threshold. This matches VAST's `pairs.py` + `finalise.py` logic. G4 is already solved — do NOT re-implement. |
| Two duplicate metric definitions (G2) | Three independent definitions exist: `photometry/metrics.py`, `photometry/variability.py`, and `lightcurves/metrics.py`. The plan is correct that consolidation is needed, but it underestimated the count. The canonical formulas in `photometry/metrics.py` are correct; the task is to make `variability.py` and `lightcurves/metrics.py` import from there. |

### Correct phase 1 scope

`photometry/metrics.py` already has the right η formula. Phase 1 is a **consolidation**, not a creation:

1. Add `vs_metric(flux_a, flux_b, err_a, err_b)` and `m_metric(flux_a, flux_b)` to `photometry/metrics.py` (they are currently only in `photometry/variability.py`).
2. Make `photometry/variability.py::calculate_vs_metric` and `calculate_m_metric` thin wrappers that import from `photometry/metrics.py`.
3. Make `lightcurves/metrics.py::compute_source_metrics` use `photometry/metrics.py` formulas.
4. Write `tests/test_metrics_canonical.py` against the consolidated module.

Do NOT skip to writing a new `photometry/metrics.py` — read the existing file first.

### Phase 2 starting point

`photometry/multi_epoch.py` already has VAST-style dataclasses (`WeightedPositionStats`, `FluxAggregateStats`, `NewSourceMetrics`, `MultiEpochSourceStats`) and helper functions (`calc_weighted_average_position`, `calc_flux_aggregates`, `calc_new_source_significance`, `compute_multi_epoch_stats`). The gap is that none of these are called during `batch_pipeline.py` execution — they exist but are orphaned.

When creating `photometry/association.py`, it does NOT need to re-implement position averaging or new-source significance — those are in `multi_epoch.py`. The association module's job is purely: given two sets of sky positions, return a mapping from detection → source_id with d2d and dr.

### Phase 3 starting point

`photometry/multi_epoch.py::calc_new_source_significance()` already computes `new_high_sigma` and `is_new` (lines 387–453). The only work in Phase 3 is wiring it into `batch_pipeline.py` and writing results to the DB.

### DB schema pattern

All existing SQLite tables in this repo are created inline via `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` inside the module that owns the data (see `calibration/jobs.py`, `calibration/qa.py`, `photometry/ese_detection.py`). Follow this pattern: create the `measurements` and `new_sources` tables inside `photometry/association.py` itself, not in a separate schema file.

### Threshold differences from VAST

DSA-110 uses `min_abs_vs = 4.3` (in `get_most_significant_pair`) vs VAST's default `min_vs = 3.0`. Before changing thresholds, read `docs/reference/photometry-and-ese.md` and `docs/reference/vast-crossref.md` — the ESE scoring system sets its own operating point independent of these pair-level filters.

### Testing

Before running: `PYTHONPATH=/data/dsa110-continuum /opt/miniforge/envs/casa6/bin/python -m pytest tests/test_variability_metrics.py tests/test_lightcurves.py -v` to establish a baseline for the affected tests. Any refactoring in Phase 1 must leave these green.

New tests go under `tests/` at the repo root. Use `numpy` arrays and synthetic scalars — do NOT require real FITS files for unit tests. The existing `test_variability_metrics.py` and `test_lightcurves.py` show the correct style.
