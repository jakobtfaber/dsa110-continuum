"""Calibration precomputation utilities.

This package provides proactive resource preparation when telescope pointing changes:
- Detecting declination changes from incoming HDF5 metadata
- Precomputing bandpass calibrator selection for new declinations
- Triggering background catalog strip database builds
- Caching transit predictions for upcoming calibrators

Moved from workflow.pipeline.precompute to proper location in core.calibration.
